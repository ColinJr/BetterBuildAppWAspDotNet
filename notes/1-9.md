Made an entity folder
make "AppUser.cs" class within

properties can be automatically done by "prop" then tab
"propfull" tab is for full property setup

property will look like
"public int propertyname {get; set; }"
public means it can be get or set by any other class in the app
private means it can only be set or changed by itself
