# What is Entity Framework?
translates code into SQL commands so we can update tables in database

DbContext class is primary way we interact with database

Entity framework works with providers, and we will use Sqlite Provider
Sqlite stores database in 1 file, is not production ready but is useful for dev because it is highly portable, and it simply adds a file in project folder for the database
